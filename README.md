# The Ruby Game

## Whatshisface
This is a _Work In Progress_ simplistic game engine based on SDL2.

Made for self-educational purposes.

## Setup

1. Required libraries

Install `sdl2`, `sdl2_image`, `sdl2_mixer` and `sdl2_ttf` libraries. For MacOS you can simply `brew install` all of them.

`ruby-sdl2` gem needs to be installed _afterwards_.
