## Whatshisface
This here is a `README.md` file, which by default serves as a starting point for yard documentation.
It uses similar Markdown sytnax as YARD does for documenting classes, modules and methods...

So you got your:

1. *italic* / _italic_ text
1. **bold** / __bold__ text
1. `monospace` / +monospace+ text


## ...BUT
Refer to {Whatchamacallit} documentation for YARD syntax examples.
